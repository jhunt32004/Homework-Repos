## Business Activities

 Bitcoin is a store of value and gives you the aqbility to hedge against banks. ETH solves the problem of decentralized finance and taking the banks out with smart contracts. 

XRP is looked to improve the speed, cost and reliability of how people transact around the world but as a hybrid between trusted financial institutions and regular people. In essence they offer improved liquidity. 

In the centralized financial world, people deposit money into banks who then lend that money to other people. The founders of XRP sought to make a trusted network where people can make transactions and send money or lend money to each other. 

But the issue was the network being trusted by the people who were using it. In order to do so, they had to create a hybrid network between trusted insitutions and the people.

*Who is the company's intended customer? Ripples XRP serves both large insitutions and retailers alike.* 

Rather you need to send money to your family in mexico or are a bank sending vast money over seas.XRP is the crypto of choice due to speed and limited exposure to risk such as fluctuations in currency price

 Many large companies use RippleNet which is Ripples main product they offer institutions and financial firms some included are American Express, Sandtander, SBI ?Holdings, Money Gram, NAtional Bank of Fujairah PJSC and Bank of America to name a few.

XRP doesn't use proof of work or smart contracts like bitcoin and ETH. They use a different system to come to a state of consensus between the network nodes thus providing increased speed for transactions making the crypto appealing for international use where currences need to be converted 

quickly to avoid currency fluctuations and fees.

Ripple is the largest holder of xrp owning roughly 50% of xrp. They created a crypto escrow with fifty five month rolling period time release thus limiting how much new xrp they can release into the market limiting counterparty risk for investors and users of its crypto.

They can do whatever they want with it if they dont use it however it goes back into the rolling escrow account.  
 
 This decision came after much critiscm over the company owning so much of the XRP available. Their transparency with the rolling escrow has since silenced most critics.


## Landscape

*What domain of the financial industry is the company in?*

 Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies 

*What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?*

Cryptocurrencies continue to evolve with alot of focus seemingly in the Decentralized financed space. New coins continue to be created looking to find new ways of financing without banks

*What are the other major companies in this domain?* 

Ripples XRP is a crypto and as such must compete with many other crypto currencies in the domain which do similair things such as Bitcoin Ethereum  Binance coin Cardano etc. However the Ripple network has a head start in being the solution for its particular problem 

and that is speed of transaction. For now XRP is the best crypto for that problem already being integrated with many institutions.





## Results

*What has been the business impact of this company so far?*

XRP has impacted banking greatly by making sending large sums of money quickly and cheaply

*What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?*

Core Metrics of a successful crypto can be a controversial topic. In terms of market cap, size and popularity, Ripples XRP is amongst the top five. Ripple Net is used by over 300 institutional clients with the success of their company

closely being tied with the success of their crypto. 



## Recommendations

*If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?* 

I would recommend for Ripple to work with the other coin providers on their network to increase airdrops given to investors that have XRP in their crypto wallets.

The ongoing battle with the SEC has created some uncertainty surrounded the crypto. Investors would be incentivized to continue to use the network while the SEC case is resolved.
